## Repository guide:
### Branches:
* Master/Main: the current EFI, which I use right now.
* Experimental: the experimental branch fotr the tests/fixes. Probably stable. 
* AMD: I've also managed to build a Hackintosh on an AMD platform, using B450/B550 chipset-based motherboards with R5-2600X and RX5700XT, so, here's the last working EFI for them. I've abandoned it, and keeping a copy if I ever need it.
